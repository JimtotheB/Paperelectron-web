              p "A respectably rugged, remarkably reliable, reconfigurable, round-robin, reverse proxy."
              p OctoRp is a dynamic reverse proxy that supports evented load balancing and round robin
                | host addressing.
              h4 Multiple Paradigms.
              p OctoRP can be run as a multi site request aggregator serving multiple backends on separate hostnames.
                | Or it cam be run as a single site load balancer, with dynamic addition and removal of backends
                | from a pool of servers.
              h4 SSL Ready.
              p With a wildcard ssl certificate OctoRP can handle TLS termination before passing the request to a
                | backend server on a private network. It can also proxy ssl requests directly to a backend if you prefer
                | to terminate directly on a backend host.
